Sydney’s cultural landscape is adorned with esteemed institutions like the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Bangarra Dance Theatre, the Australian National Maritime Museum, the country’s national opera company Opera Australia and the world renowned Sydney Opera House.

With its stunning harbour, idyllic beaches, relaxed laidback lifestyle, superb dining scene and great national parks, Sydney hardly needs cultural attractions to add to the mix, but it has them – in spades. Adding to the iconic Sydney Opera House, are the city’s cultural institutions, Aboriginal heritage and sacred sites, and annual cultural festivals such as Vivid Sydney, Sydney Festival and the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

The Rocks is a delightful district for a stroll, with its historic grain buildings and convict origins. Or take in a contemporary performance at the Sydney Opera House or one of the other contemporary cultural precincts such as Barangaroo, Darling Harbour or Woolloomooloo. The Sydney Theatre Company, Sydney Dance Company and Bangarra Dance Theatre – an internationally acclaimed Indigenous dance company – are all located in the vibrant waterfront cultural precinct of Walsh Bay.

Sydney overflows with cultural institutions such as The Art Gallery of NSW in the Domain and the Museum of Contemporary Art in The Rocks district. Relive our colonial history in living museums such as the Museum of Sydney and Vaucluse House, or beautiful hotels housed in historic quarters such as the Intercontinental, The Langham and Park Hyatt.

Take an ethnic food tour of Sydney’s various food districts such as Cabramatta, Auburn or Haymarket; drink in old pubs like Waterloo Arms or Paddington Inn; and eat in its world class restaurants, many with overwater harbour or ocean views. Enjoy Sydney’s pristine ocean surf beaches from Palm Beach and Manly in the north to Bondi and Coogee in the south, sail its magnificent harbour.
